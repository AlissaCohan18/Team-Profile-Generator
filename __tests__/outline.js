//TODO: Everything on this page :)

// I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
// WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
// THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
// WHEN I select the engineer option
// THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
// WHEN I select the intern option
// THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
// WHEN I decide to finish building my team
// THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated (Styling in pict is just an ex/)

// THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
// WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
// THEN my email opens and populates the TO field of the email
// WHEN I click on the GitHub username
// THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
  

// **Important**: Make sure that you remove `dist` from the `.gitignore` file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.

//Although it’s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.

//You are required to submit the following for review:
  // * A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application and passing tests
  // * A sample HTML file generated using your application
  // * The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a readme describing the project
